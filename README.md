# apk-parser - Android apk-file parser

> Extract Android Manifest info from an APK file.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rubenv/node-apk-parser.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rubenv/node-apk-parser)

While there are some implementations for this out in the wild, none of them handle all of the intricacies of the APK file-format. This module uses the `aapt` tool from the Android SDK to solve that problem. The tool will be downloaded and installed during `npm install`. Tested on Linux and OS X.

## Using 64-bit Ubuntu?

Newer versions of Ubuntu don't support 32-bit executables by default. `aapt` is a 32-bit executable. In order for `apk-parser` to work from 64-bit Ubuntu, you need to execute the following commands to install 32-bit support:

```ruby
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get -qqy update
sudo apt-get -qqy install libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 zlib1g:i386
```

## Getting started

Add apk-parser to your project: `npm install --save apk-parser`.

Sample usage:

```js
var parseApk = require('apk-parser');
parseApk('myApkFile.apk', function (err, data) {
    // Handle error or do something with data.
});
```

The returned data object is an object-representation of the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Here's a sample file:

```js
{
    "manifest": [
        {
            "@package": "com.example.android.snake",
            "uses-permission": [
                {
                    "@android:name": "android.permission.INTERNET"
                }
            ],
            "application": [
                {
                    "@android:label": "Snake on a Phone",
                    "activity": [
                        {
                            "@android:theme": "@0x1030006",
                            "@android:name": "Snake",
                            "@android:screenOrientation": 1,
                            "@android:configChanges": "(type 0x11)0xa0",
                            "intent-filter": [
                                {
                                    "action": [
                                        {
                                            "@android:name": "android.intent.action.MAIN"
                                        }
                                    ],
                                    "category": [
                                        {
                                            "@android:name": "android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"
                                        }
                                    ]
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Things to note:

* The top-level element is a key named `manifest`.
* Attributes are encoded by prepending their name with `@`.
* Child nodes can be accessed by name. The value is always an array, as there might be more than one array.
* This representation is unaware of the meaning of this file (you might know that there will always only be one `application` tag, the module does not). This make sure that it never breaks with future Android releases.

You can increase the buffer size when needed, but do note that it comes with a memory cost:

```js
parseApk('myApkFile.apk', 8 * 1024 * 1024, function (err, data) {
    // Handle error or do something with data.
});
```

## Contributing
All code lives in the `lib` folder. Try to stick to the style conventions used in existing code.

Tests can be run using `grunt test`. A convenience command to automatically run the tests is also available: `grunt watch`. Please add test cases when adding new functionality: this will prove that it works and ensure that it will keep working in the future.
